This Wizard read any Visual Basic project and exports it to html
pages to be compiled as *.chm file.
The steps and the informations required allow to build any help 
really fast. 

The goal of VB Help Workshop is reading a VB project file and translate
it to html pages as Programmin Guide style or Application Documentation
Once the work is done open the hhp project with Microsoft Help Workshop 
and compile it as chm file. 

Obviously this application doesn't build the final help files but
collects only the pages reading more informations as possible
from the choosen VB project. Once the html has been built, the user should 
modify the items in order to describe the features well detailed.
